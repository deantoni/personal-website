          My name is Vinicius De Antoni, and I am a generalist software engineer
          experienced on developing backend services for web, desktop and mobile
          applications as well as building user experiences with web
          technologies.
        </P>

          Throughout my career I've worked with several different technologies
          in a variety of problem spaces. From embedded software for printers to
          a costumer support system, from e-commerce platforms to desktop
          applications.
        </P>
        <P fontSize="md|lg" mt="2">
          Motivated and eager for knowledge, I am very interested in customer
          facing applications and distributed systems, and I also have passion
          for game development, artificial intelligence and music.
